        "Maybe.\n",

        "I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.\n",

        "Okay.\n",
        "Oh, there's pus!\n",
        "It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,\n",
        "- not from my body. - It smells!\n",
        "Yeah, it does.\n",
        "The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?\n",
        "- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?\n",
        "Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!\n",

        "I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.\n",
        "To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,\n",

He\\'s got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.\\nDo you want it? Yes or no.\\nIs it a good representation of his spring period?\\nNo. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton\\nwhere he lived and worked,\\n- not \"spring\" like the season. - So?\\nI think it\\'s a fair example. I think it\\'s incredibly overpriced.\\nI need it. Buy it. Store it.\\nOkay. The MIT commencement speech...\\nIs in June. Please, don\\'t harangue me about stuff that\\'s way, way, down...\\nThey\\'re haranguing me, so I\\'m gonna say yes.\\nDeflect it and absorb it. Don\\'t transmit it back to me.\\nI need you to sign this before you get on the plane.\\nWhat are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\\n- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don\\'t like it when you have plans.\\nI\\'m allowed to have plans on my birthday.\\n- It\\'s your birthday? - Yes.\\nI knew that. Already?\\nYeah. Isn\\'t that strange? It\\'s the same day as last year.\\n- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.\\n- And? - It was very nice.\\n- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\\nYou\\'re welcome, Miss Potts.\\nOkay.\\nYou\\'re good. I thought I lost you back there.\\nYou did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland.\\nI got you. I got you.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with you?\\n- What? - Three hours.\\nI got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\\nFor three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\\nWaiting on you now. Let\\'s go. Come on.\\nWheels up! Rock and roll!\\n- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.\\nCome on, sour patch. Don\\'t be mad.\\nI told you, I\\'m not mad. I\\'m indifferent, okay?\\n- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark.\\nYou don\\'t need to apologize to me. I\\'m your man.\\nHi. I told him I was sorry, but he...\\n- I\\'m just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?\\nYou don\\'t respect yourself,\\n- so I know you don\\'t respect me. - I respect you.\\nI\\'m just your babysitter.\\nSo, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.\\nLet me know and I\\'ll get you a bottle, okay?\\nHey! Heat up the sake, will you?\\n- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I\\'m not talking...\\nWe\\'re not drinking. We\\'re working right now.\\n- You can\\'t have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally\\nincapable of being responsible.\\nIt would be irresponsible not to drink. I\\'m just talking about a nightcap.\\nHot sake?\\n- Yes, two, please. - No. I\\'m not drinking. I don\\'t want any.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\\nWhen I get up in the morning and I\\'m putting on my uniform,\\nyou know what I recognize?\\nI see in that mirror that every person that\\'s got this uniform on got my back!\\nHey, you know what? I\\'m not like you. I\\'m not cut out...\\nNo, no. You don\\'t have to be like me! But you\\'re more than what you are.\\nCan you excuse me if I\\'m a bit distracted here?\\nNo! You can\\'t be distracted right now! Listen to me!\\nGeneral.\\nWelcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.\\nThanks.\\nIs it better to be feared or respected?\\nI say, is it too much to ask for both?\\nWith that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel\\nof Stark Industries\\' Freedom Line.\\nIt\\'s the first missile system\\nto incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.\\nThey say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.\\nI respectfully disagree.\\nI prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.\\nThat\\'s how Dad did it. That\\'s how America does it.\\nAnd it\\'s worked out pretty well so far.\\nFind an excuse\\nto let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you\\nthe bad guys won\\'t even want to come out of their caves.\\nFor your consideration, the Jericho.\\nI\\'ll be throwing one of these in\\nwith every purchase of 500 million or more.\\nTo peace!\\n- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?\\nI couldn\\'t sleep till I found out how it went. How\\'d it go?\\nIt went great. Looks like it\\'s gonna be an early Christmas.\\nHey! Way to go, my boy! I\\'ll see you tomorrow, yeah?\\nWhy aren\\'t you wearing those pajamas I got you?\\nGood night, Tony.\\n- Hey, Tony. - I\\'m sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\"\\nThe \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there.\\n- Nice job. - See you back at base.\\nI wouldn\\'t do that if I were you.\\nWhat the hell did you do to me?\\nWhat I did?\\nWhat I did is to save your life.\\nI removed all the shrapnel I could, but there\\'s a lot left,\\nand it\\'s headed into your atrial septum.\\nHere, want to see?\\nI have a souvenir. Take a look.\\nI\\'ve seen many wounds like that in my village.\\nWe call them the walking dead\\nbecause it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\\n- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,\\nhooked up to a car battery,\\nand it\\'s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.\\nThat\\'s right. Smile.\\nWe met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\\n- I don\\'t remember. - No, you wouldn\\'t.\\nIf I had been that drunk, I wouldn\\'t have been able to stand,\\nmuch less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\\nWhere are we?\\nCome on, stand up. Stand up!\\nJust do as I do.\\nCome on, put your hands up.\\nThose are my guns. How did they get my guns?\\nDo you understand me? Do as I do.\\nHe says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer\\n\"in the history of America.\"\\nHe is honored.\\nHe wants you to build the missile.\\nThe Jericho missile that you demonstrated.\\nThis one.\\nI refuse.\\nTony!\\nHe wants to know what you think.\\nI think you got a lot of my weapons.\\nHe says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.\\nHe wants you to make the list of materials.\\nHe says for you to start working immediately,\\nand when you\\'re done, he will set you free.\\n- No, he won\\'t. - No, he won\\'t.\\nI\\'m sure they\\'re looking for you, Stark.\\nBut they will never find you in these mountains.\\nLook, what you just saw,\\nthat is your legacy, Stark.\\nYour life\\'s work, in the hands of those murderers.\\nIs that how you want to go out?\\nIs this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?\\nOr are you going to do something about it?\\nWhy should I do anything? They\\'re going to kill me, you, either way.\\nAnd if they don\\'t, I\\'ll probably be dead in a week.\\nWell, then,\\nthis is a very important week for you, isn\\'t it?\\nIf this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up.\\nI need welding gear. I don\\'t care if it\\'s acetylene or propane.\\nI need a soldering station. I need helmets. I\\'m gonna need goggles.\\nI would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.\\n- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.\\nBut apparently, not enough for this place.\\nThey speak Arabic, Urdu,\\nDari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\\n- Who are these people? - They are your loyal customers, sir.\\nThey call themselves the Ten Rings.\\nYou know, we might be more productive\\nif you include me in the planning process.\\nOkay, we don\\'t need this.\\nWhat is that?\\nThat\\'s palladium, 0.15 grams.\\nWe need at least 1.6, so why don\\'t you go break down the other 11?\\nWhat\\'s he doing?\\nWorking.\\nCareful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.\\nRelax. I have steady hands.\\nWhy do you think you\\'re still alive?\\n- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.\\nYinsen. Nice to meet you.\\nNice to meet you, too.\\nThat doesn\\'t look like a Jericho missile.\\nThat\\'s because it\\'s a miniaturized arc reactor.\\nI got a big one powering my factory at home.\\nIt should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\\nBut what could it generate?\\nIf my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.\\nThat could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\\nYeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\\n- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?\\nFlatten them out and look.\\nOh, wow.\\nImpressive.\\nGood.\\nGood roll. Good roll.\\nYou still haven\\'t told me where you\\'re from.\\nI\\'m from a small town called Gulmira.\\n- It\\'s actually a nice place. - Got a family?\\nYes, and I will see them when I leave here.\\nAnd you, Stark?\\n- No. - No?\\nSo you\\'re a man who has everything\\nand nothing.\\nIt doesn\\'t look anything like the picture.\\nMaybe it\\'s been modified.\\nThe tail is wrong.\\nIt\\'s just backwards.\\nRelax.\\nThe bow and arrow\\nonce was the pinnacle of weapons technology.\\nIt allowed the great Genghis Khan\\nto rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.\\nAn empire twice the size of Alexander the Great\\nand four times the size of the Roman Empire.\\nBut today,\\nwhoever holds the latest Stark weapons\\nrules these lands.\\nAnd soon,\\nit will be my turn.\\nWhy have you failed me?\\nWe\\'re working.\\nDiligently.\\nI let you live.\\nThis is how you repay me?\\nIt\\'s very complex.\\nHe\\'s trying very hard.\\nOn his knees.\\nYou think I\\'m a fool?\\nI\\'ll get the truth.\\nWe\\'re both working.\\nOpen your mouth.\\nWhat does he want?\\nYou think I\\'m a fool?\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\nTell me the truth.\\nHe\\'s building your Jericho.\\nWhat do you want? A delivery date?\\nI need him.\\nGood assistant.\\nYou have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.\\nOkay? Can you move?\\nOkay, say it again.\\n41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,\\nthat\\'s from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.\\nWhere is Stark?\\nHe was here a moment ago.\\nGo look for him.\\nYinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\\nSay something. Say something back to him.\\n- He\\'s speaking Hungarian. I don\\'t... - Then speak Hungarian.\\n- Okay. I know. - What do you know?\\n- How\\'d that work? - Oh, my goodness.\\n- It worked all right. - That\\'s what I do.\\n- Let me finish this. - Initialize the power sequence.\\nOkay.\\n- Now! - Tell me. Tell me.\\nFunction 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar.\\n- It should be up right now. - Yes.\\nTalk to me. Tell me when you see it.\\n- I have it. - Press Control \"l\".\\n- \"I.\" Got it. - \"I.\" \"Enter.\" \"l\" and \"Enter.\"\\nCome over here and button me up.\\nOkay. All right.\\nEvery other hex bolt.\\n- They\\'re coming! - Nothing pretty, just get it done.\\n- Just get it done. - They\\'re coming.\\nMake sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?\\nWe need more time.\\nHey,\\n- I\\'m gonna go buy you some time. - Stick to the plan!\\nStick to the plan!\\nYinsen!\\n- Yinsen! - Watch out!\\nStark.\\nCome on. We got to go.\\nMove for me, come on. We got a plan. We\\'re gonna stick to it.\\nThis was always the plan, Stark.\\nCome on, you\\'re gonna go see your family. Get up.\\nMy family is dead.\\nI\\'m going to see them now, Stark.\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nI want this. I want this.\\nThank you for saving me.\\nDon\\'t waste it. Don\\'t waste your life.\\nMy turn.\\nNot bad.\\nHey!\\nHow was the \"fun-vee\"?\\nNext time, you ride with me, okay?\\nWatch it, coming up here.\\nAre you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.\\nYour eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?\\n- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting. - Yeah, vacation\\'s over.\\nWhere to, sir?\\n- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy. - No.\\nNo? Tony, you have to\\n- go to the hospital. - No is a complete answer.\\n- The doctor has to look at you. - I don\\'t have to do anything.\\nI\\'ve been in captivity for three months.\\nThere are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger,\\n- and the other... - That\\'s enough of that.\\n...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.\\n- Call for a press conference? - Yeah.\\n- What on earth for? - Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\\nLook at this!\\nTony.\\n- We were going to meet at the hospital. - No, I\\'m fine.\\nLook at you!\\n- You had to have a burger, yeah? - Well, come on.\\n- You get me one of those? - There\\'s only one left. I need it.\\nHey, look who\\'s here! Yeah!\\n- Miss Potts? - Yes.\\nCan I speak to you for a moment?\\nI\\'m not part of the press conference, but it\\'s about to begin right now.\\nI\\'m not a reporter.\\nI\\'m Agent Phil Coulson,\\nwith the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement\\nand Logistics Division.\\n- That\\'s quite a mouthful. - I know. We\\'re working on it.\\nYou know, we\\'ve been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...\\nWe\\'re a separate division with a more specific focus.\\nWe need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.\\n- I\\'ll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you.\\nHey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?\\nWhy don\\'t you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...\\nA little less formal and...\\n- What\\'s up with the love-in? - Don\\'t look at me.\\nI don\\'t know what he\\'s up to.\\n- Good to see you. - Good to see you.\\nI never got to say goodbye to Dad.\\nI never got to say goodbye to my father.\\nThere\\'s questions that I would have asked him.\\nI would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.\\nIf he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.\\nOr maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels.\\nI saw young Americans killed\\nby the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.\\nAnd I saw\\nthat I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.\\n- Mr. Stark! - Hey, Ben.\\nWhat happened over there?\\nI had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more\\nto offer this world than just making things that blow up.\\nAnd that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down\\nthe weapons manufacturing division of Stark International\\nuntil such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.\\nI think we\\'re gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.\\nWhat direction it should take, one that I\\'m comfortable with\\nand is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well.\\nWhat we should take away from this is that Tony\\'s back!\\nAnd he\\'s healthier than ever.\\nWe\\'re going to have a little internal discussion\\nand we\\'ll get back to you with the follow-up.\\n- Where is he? - He\\'s inside.\\nWell, that... That went well.\\nDid I just paint a target on the back of my head?\\nYour head? What about my head?\\nWhat do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\\n- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.\\nYep.\\nTony, we\\'re a weapons manufacturer.\\nObie, I just don\\'t want a body count to be our only legacy.\\nThat\\'s what we do. We\\'re iron mongers. We make weapons.\\nIt\\'s my name on the side of the building.\\nAnd what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.\\nNot based on what I saw.\\nWe\\'re not doing a good enough job.\\nWe can do better. We\\'re gonna do something else.\\nLike what? You want us to make baby bottles?\\nI think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.\\nCome on. The arc reactor, that\\'s a publicity stunt!\\nTony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up!\\n- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.\\nThe arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it.\\nArc reactor technology, that\\'s a dead end, right?\\nMaybe.\\nAm I right? We haven\\'t had a breakthrough in that in what?\\n- Thirty years. - That\\'s what they say.\\nCould you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?\\n- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It\\'s Rhodey or Pepper.\\n- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.\\n- Okay. - Okay?\\nIt works.\\nListen to me, Tony. We\\'re a team. Do you understand?\\nThere\\'s nothing we can\\'t do if we stick together,\\nlike your father and I.\\nI\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give you a heads-up, okay?\\n- But if I had... - Tony.\\nTony, no more of this \"ready, fire, aim\" business.\\n- You understand me? - That was Dad\\'s line.\\nYou gotta let me handle this.\\nWe\\'re gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.\\nWe\\'re going to have to take a lot of heat.\\nI want you to promise me that you\\'re gonna lay low.\\nStark Industries!\\nI\\'ve got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?\\nSell, sell, sell!\\nAbandon ship!\\nDoes the Hindenburg ring any bells?\\nLet me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!\\nLook, that\\'s a weapons company that doesn\\'t make weapons!\\nPepper. How big are your hands?\\n- What? - How big are your hands?\\n- I don\\'t understand why... - Get down here. I need you.\\nHey.\\nLet\\'s see them. Show me your hands.\\nLet\\'s see them.\\nOh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed.\\nI just need your help for a sec.\\nOh, my God, is that the thing that\\'s keeping you alive?\\nIt was. It is now an antique.\\nThis is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.\\nI\\'m swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.\\n- Speed bump, what does that mean? - It\\'s nothing. It\\'s just a little snag.\\nThere\\'s an exposed wire under this device.\\nAnd it\\'s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.\\nIt\\'s fine.\\n- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.\\n- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!\\nI want you to reach in, and you\\'re just gonna gently lift the wire out.\\n- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.\\nIt\\'s like Operation. You just don\\'t let it touch\\nthe socket wall or it goes \"beep.\"\\n- What do you mean, \"Operation\"? - It\\'s just a game, never mind.\\n- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great. - Okay.\\nYou know, I don\\'t think that I\\'m qualified to do this.\\nNo, you\\'re fine. You\\'re the most capable, qualified,\\ntrustworthy person I\\'ve ever met. You\\'re gonna do great.\\nIs it too much of a problem to ask? \\'Cause I\\'m...\\n- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.\\nOkay.\\nOh, there\\'s pus!\\nIt\\'s not pus. It\\'s an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,\\n- not from my body. - It smells!\\nYeah, it does.\\nThe copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?\\n- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?\\nNow, don\\'t let it touch the sides when you\\'re coming out!\\nI\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\\nThat\\'s what I was trying to tell you before.\\nOkay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don\\'t...\\nThere\\'s a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.\\n- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...\\n- Don\\'t put it back in! Don\\'t put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?\\nWhat\\'s wrong?\\nNothing, I\\'m just going into cardiac arrest\\n\\'cause you yanked it out like a trout...\\n- What? You said it was safe! - We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.\\n- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.\\n- Tony? It\\'s going to be okay. - What?\\n- Is it? - It\\'s gonna be okay.\\n- I\\'m gonna make this okay. - Let\\'s hope.\\nOkay, you\\'re gonna attach that to the base plate. Make sure you...\\nWas that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here.\\nNice.\\n- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great.\\nYou okay?\\nDon\\'t ever, ever, ever,\\never ask me to do anything like that ever again.\\nI don\\'t have anyone but you.\\nAnyway...\\n- What do you want me to do with this? - That?\\nDestroy it.\\nIncinerate it.\\nYou don\\'t want to keep it?\\nPepper, I\\'ve been called many things. \"Nostalgic\" is not one of them.\\n- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - That will be all, Miss Potts.\\nHey, Butterfingers, come here.\\nWhat\\'s all this stuff doing on top of my desk?\\nThat\\'s my phone, that\\'s a picture of me and my dad.\\nRight there. In the garbage. All that stuff.\\nThe future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?\\nI\\'ll tell you, in my experience,\\nno unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot\\'s instinct,\\nhis insight,\\nthat ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious\\nand discern its outcome, or a pilot\\'s judgment.\\nColonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?\\nLook who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.\\n- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,\\nyou gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong\\nat spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987.\\n- That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don\\'t do that!\\n- What was his name? - Don\\'t do that.\\n- Was it Ivan? - Don\\'t do that.\\nThey\\'ll believe it. Don\\'t do that.\\n- Okay. - Don\\'t do that.\\n- Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.\\n- I\\'m surprised. - Why?\\nI swear, I didn\\'t expect to see you walking around so soon.\\nI\\'m doing a little better than walking.\\n- Really? - Yeah.\\nRhodey, I\\'m working on something big.\\nI came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.\\nYou\\'re about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy,\\n\\'cause that little stunt at the press conference,\\nthat was a doozy.\\nThis is not for the military. I\\'m not... It\\'s different.\\nWhat? You\\'re a humanitarian now or something?\\n- I need you to listen to me. - No.\\nWhat you need is time to get your mind right.\\n- I\\'m serious. - Okay.\\nIt\\'s nice seeing you, Tony.\\nThanks.\\n- Jarvis, you up? - For you, sir, always.\\nI\\'d like to open a new project file, index as Mark II.\\nShall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?\\nActually, I don\\'t know who to trust right now.\\nTill further notice, why don\\'t we just keep everything on my private server?\\nWorking on a secret project, are we, sir?\\nI don\\'t want this winding up in the wrong hands.\\nMaybe in mine, it can actually do some good.\\nNext. Up.\\nNot in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me?\\nStay put. Nice.\\nYou\\'re of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this.\\nOkay, I\\'m sorry, am I in your way?\\nUp.\\nScrew it. Don\\'t even move.\\nYou are a tragedy.\\nOkay, let\\'s do this right.\\nStart mark, half a meter, and back and center.\\nDummy, look alive. You\\'re on standby for fire safety.\\nYou, roll it.\\nOkay. Activate hand controls.\\nWe\\'re gonna start off nice and easy.\\nWe\\'re gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.\\nAnd three,\\ntwo,\\none.\\nUp two. All right, set that.\\nI\\'ve been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?\\nYeah, everything\\'s... What?\\n- Obadiah\\'s upstairs. - Great!\\n- What would you like me to tell him? - Great. I\\'ll be right up.\\nOkay.\\nI thought you said you were done making weapons.\\nIt is.\\nThis is a flight stabilizer. It\\'s completely harmless.\\nI didn\\'t expect that.\\nHow\\'d it go?\\nIt went that bad, huh?\\nJust because I brought pizza back from New York\\n- doesn\\'t mean it went bad. - Sure doesn\\'t. Oh, boy.\\nIt would have gone better if you were there.\\nYou told me to lay low. That\\'s what I\\'ve been doing.\\n- I lay low, and you take care of all... - Hey, come on. In public. The press.\\n- This was a board of directors meeting. - This was a board of directors meeting?\\nThe board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress.\\nThey\\'re filing an injunction.\\n- A what? - They want to lock you out.\\nWhy, \\'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?\\nWe knew that was gonna happen.\\n- Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn\\'t matter.\\nWe own the controlling interest in the company.\\nTony, the board has rights, too.\\nThey\\'re making the case that you and your new direction\\n- isn\\'t in the company\\'s best interest. - I\\'m being responsible!\\nThat\\'s a new direction for me, for the company.\\nI mean, me on the company\\'s behalf being responsible for the way that...\\nThis is great.\\n- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I\\'ll be in the shop.\\nHey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.\\nI\\'m trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something.\\nSomething to pitch them.\\nLet me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.\\n- No. No, absolutely not. - It\\'ll give me a bone to throw the boys\\n- in New York! - This one stays with me.\\n- That\\'s it, Obie. Forget it. - All right, well, this stays with me, then.\\nGo on, here, you can have a piece.\\n- Take two. - Thank you.\\nYou mind if I come down there and see what you\\'re doing?\\nGood night, Obie.\\nDay 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option,\\nDummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again,\\nand I\\'m not on fire, I\\'m donating you to a city college.\\nAll right, nice and easy.\\nSeriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.\\nAnd three, two, one.\\nOkay.\\nPlease don\\'t follow me around with it, either,\\n\\'cause I feel like I\\'m gonna catch on fire spontaneously.\\nJust stand down! If something happens, then come in.\\nAnd again, let\\'s bring it up to 2.5.\\nThree, two, one.\\nOkay, this is where I don\\'t want to be!\\nNot the car, not the car!\\nTable!\\nCould be worse! Could be worse! We\\'re fine! Okay.\\nNo!\\nYeah, I can fly.\\n- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.\\n- Engage Heads Up Display. - Check.\\nImport all preferences from home interface.\\nWill do, sir.\\nAll right, what do you say?\\nI have indeed been uploaded, sir. We\\'re online and ready.\\nCan we start the virtual walk-around?\\nImporting preferences and calibrating virtual environment.\\nDo a check on control surfaces.\\nAs you wish.\\nTest complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.\\nYeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check.\\nStart listening in on ground control.\\nSir, there are still terabytes\\nof calculations needed before an actual flight is...\\nJarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk.\\nReady? In three, two, one.\\nHandles like a dream.\\nAll right, let\\'s see what this thing can do.\\nWhat\\'s SR-71 \\'s record?\\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\\nRecords are made to be broken! Come on!\\nSir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.\\nKeep going!\\nHigher!\\nWe iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps! Jarvis!\\nCome on, we got to break the ice!\\nKill power.\\nNotes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.\\nHull pressurization is problematic. I\\'m thinking icing is the probable factor.\\nA very astute observation, sir.\\nPerhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,\\nwe should improve the exosystems.\\nConnect to the sys. Co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.\\nUse the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.\\nThat should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.\\n- Got it? - Yes.\\nShall I render using proposed specifications?\\nThrill me.\\nTonight\\'s red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall,\\nwhere Tony Stark\\'s third annual benefit for the Firefighter\\'s Family Fund\\nhas become the place to be for L.A.\\'s high society.\\nJarvis, we get an invite for that?\\nI have no record of an invitation, sir.\\n...hasn\\'t been seen in public\\nsince his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.\\nSome claim he\\'s suffering from posttraumatic stress\\nand has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,\\nno one expects an appearance from him tonight.\\nThe render is complete.\\nA little ostentatious, don\\'t you think?\\nWhat was I thinking? You\\'re usually so discreet.\\nTell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.\\nYes, that should help you keep a low profile.\\nThe render is complete.\\nHey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\\nCommencing automated assembly.\\nEstimated completion time is five hours.\\nDon\\'t wait up for me, honey.\\nWeapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries\\nis all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...\\n- Hey, Tony, remember me? - Sure don\\'t.\\nYou look great, Hef.\\nWe\\'re going to have a great quarter.\\nWhat\\'s the world coming to when a guy\\'s got to crash his own party?\\nLook at you. Hey, what a surprise.\\nI\\'ll see you inside.\\nHey. Listen, take it slow, all right?\\nI think I got the board right where we want them.\\nYou got it. Just cabin fever. I\\'ll just be a minute.\\n- Give me a Scotch. I\\'m starving. - Mr. Stark?\\n- Yeah? - Agent Coulson.\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the...\\nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nGod, you need a new name for that.\\nYeah, I hear that a lot.\\nListen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you.\\nThere\\'s still a lot of unanswered questions,\\nand time can be a factor with these things.\\nLet\\'s just put something on the books.\\nHow about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. At Stark Industries?\\nTell you what. You got it. You\\'re absolutely right.\\nWell, I\\'m going to go to my assistant, and we\\'ll make a date.\\nYou look fantastic! I didn\\'t recognize you.\\n- What are you doing here? - Just avoiding government agents.\\n- Are you by yourself? - Yes. Where\\'d you get that dress?\\n- Oh, it was a birthday present. - That\\'s great.\\n- From you, actually. - Well, I got great taste.\\nYes.\\n- You want to dance? - Oh, no.\\n- All right, come on. - Thank you. No.\\nAm I making you uncomfortable?\\nNo. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss\\nin front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.\\n- You look great and you smell great. - Oh, God.\\nBut I could fire you if that would take the edge off.\\nI actually don\\'t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\\n- I\\'d make it a week. Sure. - Really?\\nWhat\\'s your Social Security number?\\n- Five. - Five?\\n- Right. - Right.\\nYou\\'re missing just a couple of digits there.\\nThe other eight? So I got you for the other eight.\\n- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air.\\n- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless.\\nIt was totally not harmless, by the way.\\nWe\\'re dancing. No one\\'s even watching.\\nEverybody who I work with... No, you know why?\\nI think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.\\nNo, it was not just a dance. You don\\'t understand because you\\'re you.\\nAnd everybody knows exactly who you are\\nand how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine.\\nBut, you know, then me, you\\'re my boss,\\n- and I\\'m dancing with you. - I don\\'t think it was taken that way.\\nBecause it makes me look like the one who\\'s trying to...\\n- I just think you\\'re overstating it. - You know, and we\\'re here,\\nand then I\\'m wearing this ridiculous\\ndress, and then we were dancing like that and...\\n- I would like a drink, please. - Got it, okay.\\n- I would like a vodka martini, please. - Okay.\\nVery dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast.\\nMake one of them dirty, will you?\\nWow. Tony Stark.\\n- Oh, hey. - Fancy seeing you here.\\n- Carrie. - Christine.\\nThat\\'s right.\\nYou have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.\\nCan I at least get a reaction from you?\\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\\n\\'Cause I was referring to your company\\'s\\ninvolvement in this latest atrocity.\\nYeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don\\'t know what to tell you.\\nI actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.\\nI was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn\\'t hear.\\nIs this what you call accountability?\\nIt\\'s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\\n- When were these taken? - Yesterday.\\n- I didn\\'t approve any shipment. - Well, your company did.\\nWell, I\\'m not my company.\\n- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?\\n- What\\'s going on in Gulmira? - Tony, Tony.\\n- You can\\'t afford to be this naive. - You know what? I was naive before,\\nwhen they said, \"Here\\'s the line. We don\\'t cross it.\\n\"This is how we do business.\"\\nIf we\\'re double-dealing under the table... Are we?\\nTony, your picture, please!\\nLet\\'s take a picture. Come on. Picture time!\\nTony. Who do you think locked you out?\\nI was the one who filed the injunction against you.\\nIt was the only way I could protect you.\\nNo. No.\\nThe 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described\\nas a descent into hell, into a modern day Heart of Darkness.\\nSimple farmers and herders from peaceful villages\\nhave been driven from their homes,\\ndisplaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power.\\nVillagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings\\nthey can find in the ruins of other villages,\\nor here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.\\nRecent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters\\nreferred to by locals as the Ten Rings.\\nAs you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.\\nA mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.\\nWith no political will or international pressure,\\nthere\\'s very little hope for these refugees.\\nAround me, a woman begging for news on her husband,\\nwho was kidnapped by insurgents,\\neither forced to join their militia...\\nDesperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs,\\nholding them up to anyone who will stop.\\nA child\\'s simple question, \"Where are my mother and father?\"\\nThere\\'s very little hope for these refugees,\\nrefugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.\\nHurry it up.\\nPut the women in the trucks.\\nStack the weapons here.\\nClear all the houses.\\nThat one there. Faster. Faster.\\nGrab that dog.\\nPut him with the others.\\nWhat the hell is this?\\nShoot this dog.\\nYou\\'re all incompetent.\\nTurn your head.\\nHe\\'s all yours.\\nWhat the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?\\nNo, they were using human shields. We never got the green light.\\nPut me through to State. They\\'re going to be all over this.\\nGet those monitors up!\\nWe got a bogey!\\n- Wasn\\'t Air Force! - We got the CIA on the line?\\nI\\'ve got Langley on the line. They want to know if it\\'s us.\\nNo, it definitely is not us, sir!\\n- It wasn\\'t Navy. - Wasn\\'t Marines.\\nI need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?\\n- Negative, negative. - Cannot identify.\\nGet me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now!\\nWe ran an ID check and cross-referenced\\nwith all known databases. We have nothing.\\nAny high altitude surveillance in the region?\\nWe got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.\\nSo this thing just appeared out of nowhere?\\nHow come it didn\\'t show up on the radar?\\nGot a minimal radar cross-section, sir.\\n- Is it stealth? - No, sir, it\\'s tiny.\\nWe think it\\'s an unmanned aerial vehicle.\\nColonel, what are we dealing with here?\\n- Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole.\\n- Hello? - Tony?\\n- Who\\'s this? - It\\'s Rhodes.\\n- Sorry, hello? - I said it\\'s Rhodes.\\n- Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise?\\n- Oh, yeah, I\\'m driving with the top down. - Yeah, well, I need your help right now.\\nIt\\'s funny how that works, huh?\\nYeah. Speaking of funny, we\\'ve got a weapons depot that was just blown up\\na few clicks from where you were being held captive.\\nWell, that\\'s a hot spot.\\nSounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?\\nWhy do you sound out of breath, Tony?\\nI\\'m not, I was just jogging in the canyon.\\n- I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving\\nto the canyon, where I\\'m going to jog.\\nYou sure you don\\'t have any tech in that area I should know about?\\n- Nope! - Bogey spotted!\\n- Whiplash, come in hot. - Okay, good, \\'cause I\\'m staring at one\\nright now, and it\\'s about to be blown to kingdom come.\\nThat\\'s my exit.\\nBallroom, this is Whiplash One. I\\'ve got the bogey in my sights.\\nWhiplash One, what is it?\\nI\\'ve got no idea.\\n- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.\\nThen you are clear to engage.\\nHit it.\\nThat bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!\\n- Inbound missile. - Flares!\\nWait a second. Bogey deployed flares!\\nDeploy flaps!\\nHoly!\\nThat thing just jumped off the radar, sir.\\nThe sat visual has been lost.\\nNo way that\\'s a UAV.\\nWhat is it?\\nI can\\'t see anything.\\nWhatever it was, it just bought the farm.\\nI think bogey\\'s been handled, sir.\\n- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it\\'s me.\\n- It\\'s who? - I\\'m sorry, it is me.\\nYou asked. What you were asking about is me.\\nNo, see, this isn\\'t a game.\\nYou do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.\\n- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.\\nI\\'m in it. It\\'s a suit. It\\'s me!\\nRhodey, you got anything for me?\\n- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.\\nOn your belly!\\nIt looks like a man!\\nShake him off! Roll! Roll!\\nI\\'m hit! I\\'m hit!\\nIt\\'s confirmed. He has been hit.\\nPunch out! Punch out!\\nWhiplash One down.\\nWhiplash Two, do you see a chute?\\nNegative! No chute, no chute!\\nMy chute\\'s jammed!\\nSir, I\\'ve got a visual on the bogey.\\nWhiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.\\nMajor, we don\\'t even know what we\\'re shooting at.\\n- Call off the Raptors. - That thing just took out an F-22\\ninside a legal no fly zone!\\nWhiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!\\nYou\\'ve been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.\\nKeep going!\\nGood chute! Good chute!\\n- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.\\nOh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.\\nYou owe me a plane. You know that, right?\\nYeah, well, technically, he hit me.\\nNow are you going to come by and see what I\\'m working on?\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.\\nNow, what am I supposed to tell the press?\\nTraining exercise. Isn\\'t that the usual BS?\\nIt\\'s not that simple.\\nAn unfortunate training exercise\\ninvolving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.\\nI am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.\\nAs for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,\\nit is still unclear who or what intervened,\\nbut I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.\\nHey!\\nIt is a tight fit, sir.\\nSir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.\\nBe gentle. This is my first time.\\nI designed this to come off, so... Hey.\\n- I really should be able to... - Please, try not to move, sir.\\nWhat\\'s going on here?\\nLet\\'s face it. This is not the worst thing you\\'ve caught me doing.\\nAre those bullet holes?\\nWelcome.\\nCompliments of Tony Stark.\\nIf you\\'d killed him when you were supposed to, you\\'d still have a face.\\nYou paid us trinkets to kill a prince.\\nShow me the weapon.\\nCome. Leave your guards outside.\\nHis escape bore unexpected fruit.\\nSo this is how he did it.\\nThis is only a first, crude effort.\\nStark has perfected his design.\\nHe has made a masterpiece of death.\\nA man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia.\\nAnd you dream of Stark\\'s throne.\\nWe have a common enemy.\\nIf we are still in business,\\nI will give you these designs\\nas a gift.\\nAnd in turn,\\nI hope you\\'ll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers.\\nThis is the only gift you shall receive.\\nTechnology.\\nIt\\'s always been your Achilles\\' heel in this part of the world.\\nDon\\'t worry. It\\'ll only last for 15 minutes.\\nThat\\'s the least of your problems.\\nCrate up the armor and the rest of it.\\nAll right, let\\'s finish up here.\\nSet up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,\\nand I\\'m going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers.\\nI want a prototype right away.\\nHey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?\\nI need you to go to my office.\\nYou\\'re going to hack into the mainframe and you\\'re going to retrieve all\\nthe recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip.\\nThis\\'ll get you in.\\nIt\\'s probably under Executive Files.\\nIf not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need\\nto look for the lowest numeric heading.\\nAnd what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?\\nSame drill.\\nThey\\'ve been dealing under the table, and I\\'m going to stop them.\\nI\\'m going to find my weapons and destroy them.\\nTony,\\nyou know that I would help you with anything,\\nbut I cannot help you if you\\'re going to start all of this again.\\nThere is nothing except this. There\\'s no art opening.\\nThere is no benefit. There is nothing to sign.\\nThere is the next mission and nothing else.\\nIs that so?\\nWell, then, I quit.\\nYou stood by my side all these years\\nwhile I reaped the benefits of destruction.\\nAnd now that I\\'m trying to protect the people\\nthat I put in harm\\'s way, you\\'re going to walk out?\\nYou\\'re going to kill yourself, Tony. I\\'m not going to be a part of it.\\nI shouldn\\'t be alive,\\nunless it was for a reason.\\nI\\'m not crazy, Pepper.\\nI just finally know what I have to do.\\nAnd I know in my heart that it\\'s right.\\nYou\\'re all I have, too, you know.\\nSector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?\\nYou did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.\\n- As you can see, Obadiah Stane... - Oh, my God.\\n...your deception and lies will cost you dearly.\\nThe price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.\\nSo, what are we going to do about this?\\nI know what you\\'re going through, Pepper.\\nTony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn\\'t he?\\nI was so happy when he came home.\\nIt was like we got him back from the dead.\\nNow I realize,\\nwell, Tony never really did come home, did he?\\nHe left a part of himself in that cave.\\nBreaks my heart.\\nWell, he\\'s a complicated person.\\nHe\\'s been through a lot. I think he\\'ll be all right.\\nYou are a very rare woman.\\nTony doesn\\'t know how lucky he is.\\nThank you. Thanks.\\nI\\'d better get back there.\\nIs that today\\'s paper?\\nYes.\\nDo you mind?\\n- Not at all. - Puzzle.\\nOf course.\\nTake care.\\nMs. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?\\nNope, right now. Come with me.\\n- Right now? - We\\'re going to have it right now.\\n- Yeah, walk with me. - Okay.\\nI\\'m going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.\\nYeah, we\\'ve been working our best to do it.\\nAbsolutely, we\\'re... I\\'m going to have to call you back.\\nMr. Stane? Sir, we\\'ve explored\\nwhat you\\'ve asked us, and it seems as though there\\'s a little hiccup.\\n- Actually... - A hiccup?\\nYes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn\\'t exist.\\n- So it\\'s... - Wait, wait, wait. The technology?\\nWilliam, here is the technology. I\\'ve asked you to simply make it smaller.\\nOkay, sir, and that\\'s what we\\'re trying to do, but honestly, it\\'s impossible.\\nTony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!\\nWell, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not Tony Stark.\\nTony?\\nTony, are you there? Hello?\\nBreathe.\\nEasy, easy.\\nYou remember this one, right?\\nIt\\'s a shame the government didn\\'t approve it.\\nThere\\'s so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.\\nTony.\\nWhen I ordered the hit on you,\\nI worried that I was\\nkilling the golden goose.\\nBut, you see, it was just\\nfate that you survived that.\\nYou had one last golden egg to give.\\nDo you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?\\nYour father, he helped give us the atomic bomb.\\nNow, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?\\nOh, it\\'s beautiful.\\nTony, this is your Ninth Symphony.\\nWhat a masterpiece. Look at that.\\nThis is your legacy.\\nA new generation of weapons with this at its heart.\\nWeapons that will help steer the world back on course,\\nput the balance of power in our hands.\\nThe right hands.\\nI wish you could see my prototype.\\nIt\\'s not as...\\nWell, not as conservative as yours.\\nToo bad you had to involve Pepper in this.\\nI would have preferred that she lived.\\nWhat do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?\\nPepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...\\nOkay, where\\'s Tony now?\\nI don\\'t know. He\\'s not answering his phone.\\nPlease go over there and make sure everything\\'s okay.\\nThank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.\\nGood boy.\\nTony?\\nTony!\\nTony! You okay?\\n- Where\\'s Pepper? - She\\'s fine. She\\'s with five agents.\\nThey\\'re about to arrest Obadiah.\\nThat\\'s not going to be enough.\\nSection 16. Section 16. There it is.\\nMy key\\'s not working. It\\'s not opening the door.\\nOh, wow! What\\'s that? It\\'s, like, a little device?\\nIt\\'s, like, a thing that\\'s going to pick the lock?\\nYou might want to take a few steps back.\\nThat\\'s the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\\nNot bad, huh? Let\\'s do it.\\nYou need me to do anything else?\\nKeep the skies clear.\\nDamn!\\nNext time, baby.\\nLooks like you were right. He was building a suit.\\nI thought it\\'d be bigger.\\nTake him out!\\nHow do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?\\nThe suit\\'s at 48% power and falling, sir.\\nThat chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.\\nKeep me posted.\\nPepper!\\n- Tony! Tony, are you okay? - I\\'m fine. How are...\\n- Obadiah, he\\'s gone insane! - I know.\\n- Listen, you\\'d better get out of there. - He built a suit.\\nGet out of there right now!\\nWhere do you think you\\'re going?\\nYour services are no longer required.\\nStane!\\nI love this suit!\\n- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.\\nDivert power to chest RT.\\nPower reduced to 19%.\\nLady!\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\\nFor 30 years, I\\'ve been holding you up!\\nI built this company from nothing!\\nNothing is going to stand in my way.\\nLeast of all you!\\nImpressive! You\\'ve upgraded your armor!\\nI\\'ve made some upgrades of my own!\\nSir, it appears that his suit can fly.\\nDuly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.\\nWith only 15% power, the odds of reaching that...\\nI know the math! Do it!\\nSir, you\\'re not going to believe this. That thing is back.\\nGet me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!\\nNot necessary, people. Just a training exercise.\\nYes, sir.\\n- Thirteen percent power, sir. - Climb!\\n- Eleven percent. - Keep going!\\n- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!\\nStop telling me!\\nYou had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!\\nHow\\'d you solve the icing problem?\\nIcing problem?\\nMight want to look into it.\\nTwo percent.\\nWe are now running on emergency backup power.\\n- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\\nI\\'m almost out of power. I\\'ve got to get out of this thing. I\\'ll be right there.\\nNice try!\\n- Weapons status? - Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\\nFlares!\\nVery clever, Tony.\\n- Potts? - Tony!\\nThis isn\\'t working.\\nWe\\'re going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.\\n- Well, how are you going to do that? - You\\'re going to do it.\\nGo to the central console, open up all the circuits.\\nWhen I get clear of the roof, I\\'ll let you know.\\nYou\\'re going to hit the master bypass button.\\nIt\\'s going to fry everything up here.\\nOkay. I\\'m going in now.\\nMake sure you wait till I clear the roof. I\\'ll buy you some time.\\nThis looks important!\\nI never had a taste for this sort of thing,\\nbut I must admit, I\\'m deeply enjoying the suit!\\nYou finally outdid yourself, Tony!\\nYou\\'d have made your father proud!\\nIt\\'s ready, Tony! Get off the roof!\\nTony!\\nHow ironic, Tony!\\nTrying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\\n- Pepper! - And now I\\'m going to kill you with it!\\n- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!\\n- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!\\n- Just do it! - You\\'ll die!\\nPush it!\\nTony!\\nYou\\'ve all received the official statement of what occurred\\nat Stark Industries last night.\\nThere have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned\\nand caused damage to the arc reactor.\\nFortunately, a member of Tony Stark\\'s personal security staff...\\n\"Iron Man.\" That\\'s kind of catchy. It\\'s got a nice ring to it.\\nI mean, it\\'s not technically accurate. The suit\\'s a gold-titanium alloy,\\nbut it\\'s kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.\\nHere\\'s your alibi.\\nOkay.\\n- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.\\nWe have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,\\nand sworn statements from 50 of your guests.\\nSee, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me\\nalone on the island.\\n- That\\'s what happened. - All right.\\nJust read it, word for word.\\nThere\\'s nothing about Stane here.\\nThat\\'s being handled. He\\'s on vacation.\\nSmall aircraft have such a poor safety record.\\nBut what about the whole cover story that it\\'s a bodyguard?\\nHe\\'s my... I mean, is that... That\\'s kind of flimsy, don\\'t you think?\\nThis isn\\'t my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.\\nJust stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.\\nYou\\'ve got 90 seconds.\\nAgent Coulson?\\nI just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.\\nThat\\'s what we do. You\\'ll be hearing from us.\\n- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nRight.\\n- Let\\'s get this show on the road. - You know, it\\'s actually not that bad.\\nEven I don\\'t think I\\'m Iron Man.\\n- You\\'re not Iron Man. - Am so.\\n- You\\'re not. - All right, suit yourself.\\nYou know, if I were Iron Man, I\\'d have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.\\nShe\\'d be a wreck, \\'cause she\\'d always be worrying that I was going to die,\\nyet so proud of the man I\\'d become.\\nShe\\'d be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more\\ncrazy about me.\\nTell me you never think about that night.\\n- What night? - You know.\\nAre you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof,\\nand then you went downstairs to get me a drink,\\nand you left me there, by myself?\\nIs that the night you\\'re talking about?\\nThought so.\\n- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.\\nAnd now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement.\\nHe will not be taking any questions. Thank you.\\nBeen a while since I was in front of you. I figure I\\'ll stick to the cards this time.\\nThere\\'s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred\\non the freeway and the rooftop...\\nI\\'m sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that\\nthat was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,\\n- despite the fact that you... - I know that it\\'s confusing.\\nIt is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely\\nto make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\\'m a superhero.\\nI never said you were a superhero.\\nDidn\\'t? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.\\nI\\'m just not the hero type. Clearly.\\nWith this laundry list of character defects,\\nall the mistakes I\\'ve made,\\n- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\nThe truth is\\nI am Iron Man.\\nJarvis!\\nWelcome home, sir.\\n\"I am Iron Man.\" You think you\\'re the only superhero in the world?\\nMr. Stark, you\\'ve become part of a bigger universe.\\nYou just don\\'t know it yet.\\nWho the hell are you?\\nNick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nI\\'m here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.\\n\\n\\nIRON MAN 2\\nBeen a while since I was up here in front of you.\\nMaybe I\\'ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards.\\nThere\\'s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred\\non the freeway and the rooftop...\\nSorry, Mr. Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that\\nthat was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,\\ndespite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?\\nYes.\\nAnd this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped\\nwith an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle...\\nI know that it\\'s confusing.\\nIt is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely\\nto make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\\'m a superhero.\\nI mean, let\\'s face it, I\\'m not the heroic type.\\nA laundry list of character defects,\\nall the mistakes I\\'ve made, largely public.\\nThe truth is\\nI am Iron Man.\\nIvan.\\nVanya.\\n270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15,000 feet.\\nYou are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone.\\nTony! Tony! Tony! Tony!\\nIt\\'s good to be back.\\n- You missed me? - Blow something up!\\nI missed you, too. Blow something up? I already did that.\\nI\\'m not saying that the world is enjoying\\nits longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.\\nI\\'m not saying that from the ashes of captivity,\\nnever has a greater Phoenix metaphor been personified in human history.\\nI\\'m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair,\\nsipping on an iced tea\\nbecause I haven\\'t come across anyone who\\'s man enough\\nto go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.\\nI love you, Tony!\\nPlease, it\\'s not about me.\\nIt\\'s not about you.\\nIt\\'s not even about us. It\\'s about legacy.\\nIt\\'s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations.\\nAnd that\\'s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974,\\nthe best and brightest men and women\\nof nations and corporations the world over\\nwill pool their resources, share their collective vision,\\nto leave behind a brighter future.\\nIt\\'s not about us.\\nTherefore, what I\\'m saying, if I\\'m saying anything,\\nis welcome back to the Stark Expo.\\nAnd now, making a special guest appearance\\nfrom the great beyond to tell you what it\\'s all about,\\nplease welcome my father, Howard.\\nEverything is achievable through technology.\\nBetter living, robust health,\\nand for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.\\nSo, from all of us here at Stark industries,\\nI would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future.\\nTechnology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,\\nand will one day rid society of all its ills.\\nSoon, technology will affect the way you live your life every day.\\nNo more tedious work,\\nleaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life.\\nThe Stark Expo. Welcome.\\nWe are coming to you live from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,\\nwhere Tony Stark has just walked offstage.\\nDon\\'t worry if you can\\'t make it down here tonight\\nbecause this Expo goes on all year long.\\nAnd I\\'m gonna be here checking out all the attractions\\nand the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world.\\nMake sure you join me...\\nAll right, it\\'s a zoo out there, watch out.\\n- Open up, let\\'s go. - Hey! Nice to see you.\\n- All right. Thank you. I remember you. - Tony, Tony...\\nHey, hey...\\n- Call me. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.\\nHello. It would be a pleasure.\\n- Okay. - See you, buddy.\\nThis is Larry.\\nHey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure.\\n- Nice to see you. - Call me. Call me.\\n- Larry King. - Larry!\\nYes, my people, my people.\\nCome on, Tony. There we go.\\n- Very mellow. - That wasn\\'t so bad.\\nNo, it was perfect.\\nLook what we got here, the new model.\\n- Hey, does she come with the car? - I certainly hope so.\\n- Hi. - Hi.\\n- And you are? - Marshal.\\n- Irish. I like it. - Pleased to meet you, Tony.\\nI\\'m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?\\n- Bedford. - What are you doing here?\\n- Looking for you. - Yeah? You found me.\\n- What are you up to later? - Serving subpoenas.\\nHe doesn\\'t like to be handed things.\\n- Yeah, I have a peeve. - I got it.\\nYou are hereby ordered\\nto appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee\\ntomorrow morning at 9: 00 A.M.\\n- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?\\nHe likes the badge.\\n- You still like it? - Yep.\\n- How far are we from D.C.? - D.C.? 250 miles.\\nMr. Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.\\n- Yes, dear? - Can I have your attention?\\nAbsolutely.\\nDo you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?\\n- I do not. I do not. - You do not?\\nWell, it depends on how you define the word \"weapon.\"\\n- The Iron Man weapon. - My device does not fit that description.\\nWell... How would you describe it?\\nI would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.\\n- As? - It\\'s a high-tech prosthesis.\\nThat is... That is...\\nThat\\'s actually the most apt description I can make of it.\\nIt\\'s a weapon. It\\'s a weapon, Mr. Stark.\\nPlease, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...\\nMy priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people\\n- of the United States of America. - Well, you can forget it.\\nI am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.\\nTo turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,\\nwhich is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution,\\ndepending on what state you\\'re in.\\n- You can\\'t have it. - Look, I\\'m no expert...\\nIn prostitution? Of course not. You\\'re a senator. Come on.\\nI\\'m no expert in weapons.\\nWe have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.\\nI\\'d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.\\nLet the record reflect that I observed Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,\\nand I am wondering\\nif and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.\\nAbsolutely. I\\'m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony.\\nYou\\'re the wonder boy.\\nSenator, if I may.\\nI may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?\\nYour dad. Howard Stark.\\nReally a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.\\nLet\\'s just be clear. He was no flower child.\\nHe was a lion.\\nWe all know why we\\'re here. In the last six months,\\nAnthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.\\nAnd yet he insists it\\'s a shield.\\nHe asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.\\nI wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do.\\nI\\'d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house,\\nbut this ain\\'t Canada.\\nYou know, we live in a world of grave threats,\\nthreats that Mr. Stark will not always be able to foresee.\\nThank you.\\nGod bless Iron Man. God bless America.\\nThat is well said, Mr. Hammer.\\nThe committee would now like to invite.\\nLieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.\\nRhodey? What?\\nHey, buddy. I didn\\'t expect to see you here.\\nLook, it\\'s me, I\\'m here. Deal with it. Let\\'s move on.\\nI just...\\n- Drop it. - All right, I\\'ll drop it.\\nI have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon,\\ncompiled by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record,\\ncan you please read page 57, paragraph four?\\nYou\\'re requesting that I read specific selections\\n- from my report, Senator? - Yes, sir.\\nIt was my understanding that I was going to be testifying\\nin a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.\\nI understand. A lot of things have changed today.\\n- So if you could just read... - You do understand\\nthat reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect\\n- the summary of my final... - Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.\\nVery well.\\n\"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,.\"\\n\"Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation\"\\n\"and to her interests.\"\\nI did, however, go on to summarise\\nthat the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.\\n- And that it would be in our interest... - That\\'s enough, Colonel.\\nTo fold Mr. Stark... - That\\'s enough.\\nInto the existing chain of command, Senator.\\nI\\'m not a joiner, but I\\'ll consider Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.\\nWe can amend the hours a little bit.\\nI\\'d like to go on and show, if I may,\\nthe imagery that\\'s connected to your report.\\nI believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images\\n- to the general public at this time. - With all due respect,\\nColonel, I understand.\\nAnd if you could just narrate those for us, we\\'d be very grateful.\\nLet\\'s have the images.\\nIntelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos\\nare, in fact, attempts at making manned copies\\nof Mr. Stark\\'s suit.\\nThis has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,\\nindicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.\\nHold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.\\nBoy, I\\'m good. I commandeered your screens.\\nI need them. Time for a little transparency.\\n- Now, let\\'s see what\\'s really going on. - What is he doing?\\nIf you will direct your attention to said screens...\\nI believe that\\'s North Korea.\\nCan you turn that off? Take it off.\\nIran.\\nNo grave immediate threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?\\nHow did Hammer get in the game?\\nJustin, you\\'re on TV. Focus up.\\nOkay, give me a left twist. Left\\'s good. Turn to the right.\\nOh, shit. Oh, shit!\\nWow.\\nYeah, I\\'d say most countries, five, 10 years away.\\nHammer Industries, 20.\\nI\\'d like to point out that that test pilot survived.\\nI think we\\'re done, is the point that he\\'s making.\\n- I don\\'t think there\\'s any reason... - The point is, you\\'re welcome, I guess.\\n- For what? - Because I\\'m your nuclear deterrent.\\nIt\\'s working. We\\'re safe. America is secure.\\nYou want my property? You can\\'t have it.\\nBut I did you a big favour.\\nI\\'ve successfully privatized world peace.\\nWhat more do you want? For now!\\nI tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.\\nYou, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.\\nWe\\'re adjourned. We\\'re adjourned for today.\\n- Okay. - You\\'ve been a delight.\\nMy bond is with the people.\\nAnd I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.\\nIf there\\'s one thing I\\'ve proven\\nit\\'s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.\\nWake up. Daddy\\'s home.\\nWelcome home, sir.\\nCongratulations on the opening ceremonies.\\nThey were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.\\nAnd may I say how refreshing it is\\nto finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.\\nYou!\\nI swear to God I\\'ll dismantle you. I\\'ll soak your motherboard.\\nI\\'ll turn you into a wine rack.\\nHow many ounces a day of this gobbledegook\\nam I supposed to drink?\\nWe are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.\\nCheck palladium levels.\\nBlood toxicity, 24%.\\nIt appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit\\nis accelerating your condition.\\nAnother core has been depleted.\\nGod, they\\'re running out quick.\\nI have run simulations on every known element,\\nand none can serve as a viable replacement\\nfor the palladium core.\\nYou are running out of both time and options.\\nUnfortunately, the device that\\'s keeping you alive\\nis also killing you.\\nMiss Potts is approaching.\\n- I recommend that you inform her... - Mute.\\nIs this a joke?\\n- What are you thinking? - What?\\n- What are you thinking? - Hey, I\\'m thinking I\\'m busy.\\nAnd you\\'re angry about something.\\nDo you have the sniffles? I don\\'t wanna get sick.\\n- Did you just donate... - Keep your business.\\nOur entire modern art collection to the...\\n- Boy Scouts of America. ...Boy Scouts of America?\\nYes. It is a worthwhile organisation.\\nI didn\\'t physically check the crates but, basically, yes.\\nAnd it\\'s not \"our\" collection, it\\'s my collection. No of fence.\\nNo, you know what? I think I\\'m actually entitled\\nto say \"our\" collection\\nconsidering the time that I put in, over 10 years,\\n- curating that. - It was a tax write-off. I needed that.\\nYou know, there\\'s only about 8,011things\\nthat I really need to talk to you about.\\nDummy. Hey, stop spacing out.\\nThe Bridgeport\\'s already machining that part.\\nThe Expo is a gigantic waste of time.\\nI need you to wear a surgical mask until you\\'re feeling better.\\n- Is that okay? - That\\'s rude.\\nThere\\'s nothing more important to me than the Expo.\\nIt\\'s my primary point of concern.\\n- I don\\'t know why you\\'re... - The Expo is your ego gone crazy.\\nWow. Look at that.\\nThat\\'s modern art. That\\'s going up.\\n- You\\'ve got to be kidding. - I\\'m gonna put this up right now.\\n- This is vital. - Stark is in complete disarray.\\n- You understand that? - No. Our stocks have never been higher.\\n- Yes, from a managerial standpoint. - You are... Well, if it\\'s messy,\\n- then let\\'s double back. - Let me give you an example.\\n- Let\\'s move on to another subject. - No, no, no, no.\\nYou are not taking down the Barnett Newman\\n- and hanging that up! - I\\'m not taking it down.\\nI\\'m just replacing it with this.\\n- Let\\'s see what I can get going here. - Okay, fine.\\nMy point is, we have already awarded contracts\\n- to the wind farm people. - Yeah. Don\\'t say \"wind farm.\"\\n- I\\'m already feeling gassy. - And to the plastic plantation tree,\\nwhich was your idea, by the way. Those people are on payroll...\\n- Everything was my idea... and you won\\'t make a decision.\\nI don\\'t care about the liberal agenda any more.\\nIt\\'s boring. Boring. I\\'m giving you a boring alert.\\n- You do it. - I do what?\\nExcellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.\\n- Yeah, I\\'m trying to run the company. - Pepper, I need you to run the company.\\n- Well, stop trying to do it and do it. - You will not\\n- give me the information... - I\\'m not asking you to try...\\nin order to... - I\\'m asking you\\nto physically do it. I need you to do it.\\n- I am trying to do it. - Pepper, you\\'re not listening to me!\\n- No, you are not listening to me. - I\\'m trying to make you CEO.\\nWhy won\\'t you let me?\\n- Have you been drinking? - Chlorophyll.\\nI hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,\\neffective immediately.\\nYeah, done deal. Okay?\\nI\\'ve actually given this a fair amount of thought,\\nbelieve it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,\\ntrying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.\\nAnd then I realised\\nit\\'s you. It\\'s always been you.\\nI thought there\\'d be a legal issue,\\nbut actually I\\'m capable of appointing my successor.\\nMy successor being you.\\nCongratulations?\\n- Take it, just take it. - I don\\'t know what to think.\\nDon\\'t think. Drink.\\nThere you go.\\nThe notary\\'s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?\\nI\\'m on happy time.\\n- Sorry. - What the hell was that?\\nIt\\'s called mixed martial arts. It\\'s been around for three weeks.\\nIt\\'s called dirty boxing. There\\'s nothing new about it.\\nAll right, put them up. Come on.\\nI promise you this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.\\nI need you to initial each box.\\nLesson one. Never take your eye off...\\nThat\\'s it. I\\'m done.\\n- What\\'s your name, lady? - Rushman. Natalie Rushman.\\nFront and center. Come into the church.\\n- No. You\\'re seriously not gonna ask... - If it pleases the court, which it does.\\n- It\\'s no problem. - I\\'m sorry. He\\'s very eccentric.\\nWhat?\\n- Can you give her a lesson? - No problem.\\n- Pepper. - What?\\n- Who is she? - She is from legal.\\nAnd she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit\\n- if you keep ogling her like that. - I need a new assistant, boss.\\nYes, and I\\'ve got three excellent potential candidates.\\nThey\\'re lined up and ready to meet you.\\nI don\\'t have time to meet. I need someone now.\\nI feel like it\\'s her.\\nNo, it\\'s not.\\n- You ever boxed before? - I have, yes.\\nWhat, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?\\n- How do I spell your name, Natalie? - R-U-S-H-M-A-N.\\n- What, are you gonna Google her now? - I thought I was ogling her.\\n- Wow. Very, very impressive individual. - You\\'re so predictable, you know that?\\nShe\\'s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin.\\n- Who speaks Latin? - No one speaks Latin.\\n- No one speaks Latin? - It\\'s a dead language.\\nYou can read Latin or you can write Latin,\\n- but you can\\'t speak Latin... - Did you model in Tokyo?\\n- \\'Cause she modeled in Tokyo. - Well...\\nI need her. She\\'s got everything that I need.\\nRule number one, never take your eye off your opponent.\\nOh, my God!\\n- Happy! - That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\\n- I just slipped. - You did?\\n- Yeah. - Looks like a TKO to me.\\nJust... I need your impression.\\nYou have a quiet reserve. I don\\'t know, you have an old soul.\\n- I meant your fingerprint. - Right.\\n- So, how are we doing? - Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.\\n- You\\'re the boss. - Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\n- No. - Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.\\nThank you very much.\\n- I want one. - No.\\nYou know, it\\'s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,\\n- just go with it. - Go with it? Go with what?\\n- Mr. Stark? - Hey.\\nHello. How was your flight?\\nIt was excellent. Boy, it\\'s nice to see you.\\nWe have one photographer from the ACM, if you don\\'t mind. Okay?\\n- When did this happen? - What? You made me do it.\\n- I made you do what? - You quit. Smile. Look right there.\\nStop acting constipated.\\n- Don\\'t flare your nostrils. - You are so predictable.\\n- That\\'s the amazing thing. - Right this way.\\n- You look fantastic. - Why, thank you very much.\\nBut that\\'s unprofessional. What\\'s on the docket?\\nYou have a 9: 30 dinner.\\n- Perfect. I\\'ll be there at 11: 00. - Absolutely.\\n- Is this us? - It can be.\\n- Great. Make it us. - Okay.\\n- Mr. Musk. How are you? - Hi, Pepper.\\n- Congratulations on the promotion. - Thank you very much.\\nElon, how\\'s it going? Those Merlin engines are fantastic.\\nThank you. Yeah, I\\'ve got an idea for an electric jet.\\n- You do? - Yeah.\\nThen we\\'ll make it work.\\n- You want a massage? - Oh, God. No,\\n- I don\\'t want a massage. - I\\'ll have Natalie make an...\\n- I don\\'t want Natalie to do... - Don\\'t want you tense.\\nBy the way, I didn\\'t mean to spring this on you.\\nThank you very much.\\n- Green is not your best colour. - Oh, please.\\nAnthony! Is that you?\\n- My least favourite person on Earth. - Hey, pal.\\n- Justin Hammer. - How you doing?\\nYou\\'re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.\\nYou know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.\\n- You guys know each other? - Hi.\\n- Yes. - Yes.\\n- Yes, roughly. - We do.\\nBTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.\\n- I know. I know. - Congratulations.\\nMy editor will kill me if I don\\'t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.\\n- Can I? - Sure.\\nShe\\'s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.\\nI thought I\\'d throw her a bone, you know.\\n- Right. - Right?\\nWell, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.\\nAnd she wrote a story as well.\\n- It was very impressive. - That was good.\\n- Very well done. - Thank you.\\n- I\\'m gonna go wash. - Don\\'t leave me.\\n- Hey, buddy. How you doing? - I\\'m all right.\\n- Looking gorgeous. - Please, this is tough.\\nCan I ask you... Is this the first time...\\nFromage.\\n- Say, \"Brie.\" ...that you guys have seen each other?\\nGod, that\\'s so awful.\\nListen, is it the first time you\\'ve seen each other since the Senate?\\nSince he got his contract revoked...\\n- Actually, it\\'s on hold... when you were attempting to...\\nThat\\'s not what I heard. What\\'s the difference between \"hold\"\\n- and \"cancelled\"? The truth? - Yes, what is?\\nNo. The truth is... Why don\\'t we put that away?\\nThe truth is, I\\'m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.\\nWell, if you invent something that works,\\nI\\'ll make sure I get you a slot.\\n- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready. - Yes?\\nI actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.\\n- Hammer needs a slot, Christine. - We kid, yeah.\\nWe kid. We\\'re kidders.\\nGot any other bad ideas?\\nTony!\\nTony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We\\'re not competitors.\\nHim being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities\\nfor Hammer Industries, you know?\\n- Everything that Tony and I do... - Well, what\\'s the use of having...\\nis a healthy... and owning a race car...\\ncompetition... if you don\\'t drive it?\\nIs he driving?\\nNatalie. Natalie!\\n- Yes, Miss Potts? - Did you know about this?\\nThis is the first that I have known of it.\\nThis... This cannot happen.\\nAbsolutely. I understand. How can I help you?\\n- Where\\'s Happy? - He\\'s waiting outside.\\n- Okay, get him. I need Happy. - Right away.\\nTony\\'s... You know, he...\\nWe\\'re not competitive. You know what I mean?\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. You know,\\n- can you excuse me just one second? - Just read me what you wrote.\\n- I will. I will, after. - Just read it back to me.\\nBut I have to make one quick phone call.\\n- Where are you going? - This is great.\\n- I\\'ve got some caviar coming. - This is great stuff.\\n- I\\'ll be right back. - Look!\\nThat\\'s Stark.\\nGo, go!\\nHang on.\\n- Give me the case. - Here. Take it.\\n- Where\\'s the key? - It\\'s in my pocket.\\nCar!\\nOh, my God!\\n- Are you okay? - Yeah.\\n- Were you heading for me or him? - I was trying to scare him.\\n- \\'Cause I can\\'t tell! - Are you out of your mind?\\n- Better security. - Get in the car right now!\\nI was attacked! We need better security.\\n- Get in the car! - You\\'re CEO. Better security measures.\\nGod, it\\'s embarrassing.\\nFirst vacation in two years.\\nOh, my God!\\n- I got him! - Hit him again. Hit him again.\\nFootball.\\n- I got him! - Take the case! Take it!\\n- Take the case! - Give him the case!\\nStop banging the car!\\nCalm down.\\nGod! God!\\nGive me the case! Please! Come on!\\nYou... You lose.\\nYou lose. You lose, Stark.\\nPretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low.\\nYou could have doubled up your rotations.\\nYou focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.\\nIt\\'s effective. Not very efficient.\\nBut it\\'s a passable knock-off.\\nI don\\'t get it. A little fine tuning,\\nyou could have made a solid paycheck.\\nYou could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran,\\nor gone right to the black market.\\nYou look like you got friends in low places.\\nYou come from a family of thieves and butchers.\\nAnd now, like all guilty men,\\nyou try to rewrite your own history.\\nAnd you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.\\nSpeaking of thieves, where did you get this design?\\nMy father. Anton Vanko.\\nWell, I never heard of him.\\nMy father is the reason you\\'re alive.\\nThe reason I\\'m alive is \\'cause you had a shot, you took it,\\nyou missed.\\nDid I?\\nIf you can make God bleed,\\nthe people will cease to believe in him.\\nAnd there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come.\\nThe truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch\\nas the world will consume you.\\nWhere will you be watching the world consume me from?\\nThat\\'s right. A prison cell. I\\'ll send you a bar of soap.\\nHey, Tony. Before you go,\\npalladium in the chest, painful way to die.\\nIt\\'s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle\\nand this man has no idea what he\\'s doing.\\nHe thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.\\nI was at a hearing where Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant\\nthat these suits can\\'t exist anywhere else,\\ndon\\'t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else,\\nat least for five to 10 years,\\nand here we are in Monaco realising, \"These suits exist now.\"\\nMute.\\nHe should be giving me a medal. That\\'s the truth.\\n- What is that? - This is your in-flight meal.\\nDid you just make that?\\nYeah. Where do you think I\\'ve been for three hours?\\nTony,\\nwhat are you not telling me?\\nI don\\'t want to go home. At all.\\nLet\\'s cancel my birthday party and...\\nWe\\'re in Europe. Let\\'s go to Venice, Cipriani.\\n- Remember? - Oh, yes.\\nIt\\'s a great place to\\n- be healthy. - I don\\'t think this is the right time.\\nWe\\'re in kind of a mess.\\nYeah, but maybe that\\'s why it\\'s the best time.\\n- \\'Cause then we... - Well, I think as the CEO,\\nI need to show up.\\nAs CEO, you are entitled to a leave.\\n- A leave? - A company retreat.\\n- A retreat? During a time like this? - Just a ride.\\nWell, I\\'m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.\\nNot everybody runs on batteries, Tony.\\nHey, there he is.\\nThere he is.\\nWhat an absolute pleasure. Welcome.\\nOh, goodness gracious.\\nCan we get the handcuffs off my friend here?\\nForgive me, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m such a huge fan of yours.\\nI didn\\'t want to make a first impression like this.\\nHe\\'s not an animal. Come on.\\nHe\\'s a human being. Thank you.\\nWe\\'re fine.\\nMy name is Justin Hammer.\\nI\\'d like to do some business with you. Please sit.\\nDig in. What do we have today, Jack?\\n- We have some salmon carpaccio. - Salmon carpaccio.\\nAnything you want here, we got it.\\nI like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco.\\nIt\\'s Italian, though.\\nOrganic ice cream.\\nI got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.\\nWhat I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track,\\nhow you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody,\\nthat was... Wow!\\nYou spoke to me with what you did.\\nAnd I know that you knew that I\\'d be listening.\\nThis is why I couldn\\'t bear to have you shipped off\\nto God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.\\nBut if I might make a suggestion,\\nyou know, you don\\'t just go and try and kill the guy.\\nI think, if I may, you go after his legacy.\\nThat\\'s what you kill.\\nYou and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.\\nThe only difference between you and I is that I have resources.\\nI think, if I may,\\nyou need my resources.\\nSomeone behind you, a benefactor.\\nI\\'d like to be that guy.\\nOkay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator.\\nI don\\'t know. Have you been understanding everything I\\'m saying?\\nVery good, man.\\n- Very good, man. - Very good, man.\\nHey!\\n- Hey. - Yes?\\nI want my bird.\\n- A bird? You want a bird? - I want my bird.\\nI can get you a bird. I can get you 10 birds.\\nI want my bird.\\nWell, okay. Nothing\\'s impossible. I could...\\nAre we talking about... Is this a bird back in Russia?\\nYes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong\\n- despite the events in Monaco. - Yes, of course.\\n- The AP wants a quote. - Don\\'t tell him. Fax them...\\nWhere is he?\\n- He doesn\\'t want to be disturbed. - He\\'s downstairs.\\nWhat happened in Monaco? - Yes, but...\\nBut his continuing erratic behaviour\\nmay lead many people to ask themselves,\\n\"Can this man still protect us?\"\\nIron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.\\nQuery complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist\\nwho defected to the United States in 1963.\\nHowever, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.\\nHis son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,\\nwas convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,\\nand served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.\\nNo further records exist.\\nTony, you gotta get upstairs\\nand get on top of this situation right now.\\nListen. I\\'ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day,\\ntrying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH,\\nknocking down your front door and taking these.\\nThey\\'re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?\\nThey\\'re sick of the games.\\nYou said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.\\nWell, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday.\\nIt\\'s not theoretical any more.\\nAre you listening to me?\\n- Are you okay? - Let\\'s go.\\nHey, man. Hey, hey!\\n- You all right? - Yeah, I should get to my desk.\\n- See that cigar box? - Yeah.\\nIt\\'s palladium.\\nIs that supposed to be smoking?\\nIf you must know, it\\'s neutron damage. It\\'s from the reactor wall.\\nYou had this in your body?\\nAnd how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?\\nRoad rash.\\nThank you.\\n- What are you looking at? - I\\'m looking at you.\\nYou wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act\\nand it\\'s unnecessary. You don\\'t have to do this alone.\\nYou know, I wish I could believe that. I really do.\\nBut you\\'ve gotta trust me.\\nContrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I\\'m doing.\\nThis is where we do it. This is my humble abode.\\nYou can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right?\\nNo pressure.\\nHere they are. I\\'m very excited. They\\'re combat-ready.\\nI may have done a few miscalculations\\nand rushed the prototype into production.\\nSue me, I\\'m enthusiastic.\\nGo ahead, take a look around.\\nYou don\\'t wanna do that.\\nYou\\'ll be able to access that\\nas soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.\\nCan we generate some encrypted pass codes?\\nGet some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.\\nNever mind, I...\\nWow. Okay. Good stuff.\\n- Sorry? - Software shit.\\nWell...\\nYou\\'re good.\\nYou really blasted in past the firewall there.\\nLet me show you where you\\'re gonna be working primarily.\\nGo ahead, take a look.\\nGet a good look at that. That\\'s something, isn\\'t it?\\nYou know, those are really just for show and tell.\\nThey\\'re $125.7 million a pop, so... Wait! Oh, gosh.\\nJesus Christ. Get somebody up here.\\nThat\\'s where the pilot goes.\\nI\\'m having a tough time finding volunteers.\\nI\\'ll take care of that, just leave it.\\nWhat you want them do?\\nWell, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.\\nI want to make Iron Man look like an antique.\\nI wanna go to that Stark Expo,\\nI wanna take a dump in Tony\\'s front yard.\\nYou know what I\\'m talking about?\\n- I can do that. No problem. - Yeah?\\nHey, fabulous! I love it.\\nHey, this is our guy. Didn\\'t I tell you? I had a feeling.\\nDo you know which watch you\\'d like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?\\nI\\'ll give them a look.\\nI should cancel the party.\\n- Probably. - Yeah.\\n- \\'Cause it\\'s... - Ill-timed.\\nRight, sends the wrong message.\\nInappropriate.\\nIs that dirty enough for you?\\nGold face, brown band. The Jaeger. I\\'ll give that a look.\\nBring them over here.\\nI\\'ll take that. Why don\\'t you...\\nI gotta say it. It\\'s hard to get a read on you.\\n- Where are you from? - Legal.\\nCan I ask you a question, hypothetically?\\nBit odd.\\nIf this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have,\\nhow would you celebrate it?\\nI\\'d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.\\n- Good evening. - Good evening.\\nYes, sir, I understand.\\nNo. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I\\'ll handle it.\\nSir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,\\nIron Man will be back on watch.\\nHey, Pepper.\\nI\\'m going to go get some air.\\nWhat\\'s wrong?\\n- I don\\'t know what to do. - You gotta be kidding me.\\n- That\\'s it. I\\'m making... Pepper. - No, no, no. Don\\'t call anyone.\\nThis is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.\\nI know. I know. I get it.\\nI\\'m gonna handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.\\nHandle it. Or I\\'m gonna have to.\\nYou know, the question I get asked most often is,\\n\"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?\"\\nJust like that.\\nDoes this guy know how to throw a party or what?\\nI love you.\\nUnbelievable! Thank you so much.\\nTony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.\\nAnd we\\'re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.\\nNo, no, no, we can\\'t... Wait, wait, wait.\\nWe didn\\'t have the cake. We didn\\'t blow out the candles.\\nYou\\'re out of control, okay? Trust me on this one, okay?\\n- You\\'re out of control, gorgeous. - It\\'s time to go to bed. It\\'s time.\\n- Give me another smooch. - You\\'re not going to be\\n- happy about this. - Come on, you know you want to.\\nYou just peed the suit.\\n- I know.
